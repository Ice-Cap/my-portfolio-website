            I'm a web developer with 2 years of experience building custom websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, and React. My main focus is to build websites that provide real-world value for my clients. I write all of my code semantically to ensure it's optimized for SEO and I code my websites to be fully mobile responsive and cross-browser compatible as well.
